  <p>
  I've bought hundreds, maybe thousands, of Marklin toys in my years of collecting and I'm always finding new rarities from estates, auctions, individuals, and collectors around the world.  If you have a Marklin toy or train or even an entire collection, I would be happy to get in contact with you and help you in any way possible.  Since I am a hobbyist and collector, without a storefront, a sales team, or a purchasing quota, I will answer your questions personally and quickly and look forward to seeing some great Marklin toys!
